UCETD LaTeX Class & Template
============================

This repository includes a LaTeX class and template for
correctly formatted electronic Ph.D. dissertations at the University of Chicago.

The [official format specification][spec] can be tough to meet from scratch.
That's why we are providing this class and template. The class, when properly
used as in the template, will make sure your dissertation meets the spec.

As I no longer work at the university, I don't have time to support or maintain
this package.

Get Started
===========

1. Get your LaTeX environment set up.
